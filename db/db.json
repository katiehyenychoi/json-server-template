          "userReview": "This shop is serving some great coffee in the Timeout Market.I came early to the market because I have a haircut appointment. I see seating and peek into the Feed Shop. Behind all of the clothing made from Coke bottles is a barista who knows how to properly use an espresso machine.There are lots of choices: espresso, lattes as well as regular drip coffee. All with beans from La Colombe coffee. There was a festive latte but I'm in Brooklyn and I want a proper Flat White. My Flat White came to me quickly, by the fixin' bar I noticed there were a few milk choices. The latest rage is oatmilk and they had a container out for us patrons to partake.While waiting and sippin' Java, I see people walking into the market with their dogs. A woman walks in with tea cup Maltese. With a festive sweater no less!",

          "userReview": "My South African friend and American friend who lives in Australia both suggested this was THE PLACE to get THE BEST FLAT WHITE in NYC. I met them in Australia so I trusted their coffee opinions. I have yet to name a place #1 for coffee in NYC... I went in and ordered my flat white. It came without cafe art which made me wonder if it was going to be great BUT it was THE BEST. It's in a great location to get good photos (Brooklyn bridge), for tourist if you want to look at different things or if you want to go on a date and quickly pop in here for the best flat white. This area has many options and I truly recommend you try it!",

          "userReview": "Matcha latte with oat milk was amazing, 1000x better than Starbucks - authentic, high quality matcha flavor, and that's for a place where the cafe is not the main part of their business. I am never going to Starbucks  for anything (other than restroom if that) anymore.I ordered the matcha tea and carrot sunflower seeds muffin. The matcha was done well. The water was at the right temperature and the matcha itself was soothing. I shared the muffin with my friend. The muffin along with other available pastries were very creative. The muffin wasn't too sweet though I thought it well was a bit small.My friend ordered pastries & she mentioned how the workers got some as well which means it must be really good, which acccording to my 3 friends they enjoyed the pastries.",

They seem to have more selection nowadays compared to the Chinatown Bibble & Sip due to covid, so if you're looking for a better selection of their cute desserts, definitely make your way over here! The earl grey cream puff is so creamy and has a great but not overwhelming earl grey vanilla flavor. I love the tarts too and my favorite is the raspberry lychee one. The earl grey banana bread is my must order item with every visit I make and is so delicious when warmed up. You can't go wrong with their drinks either. I'm more of a tea person so I'm in love with their Passionfruit Jasmine Iced Tea",

          "userReview": "Located not far from Time Square this is a must go place if you love sweets and drinks. My friends and I ordered the matcha white chocolate/earl/black sesame grey/ brown sugar boba cream puffs, iced matcha latte, totoro macaroons, and some tarts to go as well. Love the variety of sweets here. The earl grey and matcha cream puffs are a must order. The puffs here are the best I've ever had. Large in size, thick crispy outer shell with soft interior with delish airy filling. Between the 4 us of we could only finish 3. They have no seating inside due to Covid, but they have some chairs outside. Highly recommend B & S if you want some quality creamy puffs or sweets in general.",
